					</h3>
			
			<p>Before offically becoming Boyne RFC in 1998, Drogheda and Delvin amalgamted to become 
			one club.In youth rugby Drogheda and Delvin were very successful in underage rugby winning many 
			trophies.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Leinster Junior cup</li>
				<li>The Eddie Maher Invitational</li>
				<li>The All Ireland Championship</li>
			</ul>

			club respectively were rejected, a deal was agreed to form a new team <b>Boyne RFC</b>.
